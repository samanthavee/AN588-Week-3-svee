# Preliminaries

Set working directory and load relevant libraries:
```{r libraries, eval= FALSE}
library(prettydoc)
library(yaml)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Homework Questions
Every Saturday morning, at the same time, a primatologist goes and sits in the forest to listen for titi monkey calls, counting the number of calls they hear in a 2 hour window from 5am to 7am. Based on previous knowledge, she believes that the mean number of calls she will hear in that time is exactly 15. Let X represent the appropriate Poisson random variable of the number of calls heard in each monitoring session. <br><br>
lambda = 15 [this is the probability mass function for the poisson distribution, aka mean number of occurrences of event in given interval] <br>
X = number of calls heard in a 2 hr window

## 1. What is the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?
I looked at the R documentation for the ppois() function to help me start this
```{r q1}
ppois(q = 8, lambda = 15, lower.tail = F)
# lower.tail is set to FALSE because we want more than 8 calls (so 9 or higher)
```

## 2. What is the probability that she will hear no calls in a session?
I'm using the same ppois() function as the previous function
```{r q2a}
ppois(q = 0, lambda = 15) 
# hearing up to and including 0 calls so i didn't set lower.tail to F like i did previously
```

Reese suggested using dpois instead of ppois since we are only taking the probability at one point. 
```{r q2b}
dpois(x = 0, lambda = 15)
# same result, like reese said! 
```

## 3. What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session?
I'm not using the ppois() function again because the question is asking about hearing *exactly* 3 calls <br>
Instead, I'm using the dpois() function to find the probability of a certain number of successes occurring 
```{r q3}
dpois(x = 3, lambda = 15)
# reese mentioned that if i want to make this shorter, i can also use dpois(3, 15)
```

## 4. Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30.
```{r q4}
# assigning all values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30 to variable x
x <- 1:30 

# creating variable where i calculate dpois using previous info
massfunctionplot <- dpois(x = x, lambda = 15)

# making mass function plot, removing space between individual bars, making title and labeling axes
barplot(massfunctionplot, names.arg = x, space = 0, xlab = "x", ylab = "Pr(X = x)", 
        main = "Poisson Probability Mass Function")
```

## 5. Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions).
The function rpois() will generate or 'simulate' a list of random variables that follow a poisson distribution with a certain rate of success.
```{r q5}
# n = 104 because that's how many results we want to simulate, lambda = 15 as usual
simulate <- rpois(n = 104, lambda = 15)
simulate
```

## 6. Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30. How does your histogram compare to the shape of the probability mass function you plotted above?
```{r q6}
hist(simulate, xlim = range(0:30), breaks = c(1:30), probability = TRUE, 
     main = "Simulated results from poisson distribution", 
     xlab = "Number of calls heard", ylab = "Probability")
```
<br> This histogram has roughly the same shape as the probability mass function plotted previously. The probabilities of calls heard for the simulated data is less evenly distributed between 0-30.


# Challenges Faced
1. I was having trouble understanding the difference between the ppois() and dpois() functions and when they should be used. [This link](https://www.statology.org/dpois-ppois-qpois-rpois-r/) helped me understand it better. <br>
2. Question 5 initially threw me off because I read "simulate" and got scared. The R documentation wasn't very helpful so I referred back to the same link mentioned above. I realized that the rpois() function could help me and that I didn't have to do anything too intense. <br>
3. I'm more familiar plotting with {ggplot2} than the base R package. I had to check the R documentation to figure out how to set horizontal limits for the last question because the packages use different syntax.<br>
4. The cayman theme didn't show up when I initially knit my document. I had to search how the prettydoc package worked and how to use the correct syntax <br>
5. I keep receiving an error about YAML parsing when I tried to knit. I spent an embarrassing amount of time trying to figure out what was wrong with my code and finally made the error go away by removing "---" between sections. I originally included those to draw lines between sections.

# Changes made to final code
1. I used Reese's comments to replicate question 2 with dpois instead of ppois! I referenced my notes to understand why we get the same result with different functions.
2. I added a comment in chunk 'q3' noting a shorter way to write out the function. I kept the longer form so I know what each number is referring to.
3. For question 5, I returned the 'simulate' variable so I can actually see the output of simulated results (thanks Reese!)
4. I added 'probability = TRUE' to my histogram in question 6. It originally showed frequency but now it shows the probability of each point in each interval.
5. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to keep peer comments in the final code but for the sake of making the final knitted doc look clean, I deleted Reese's comments :(
