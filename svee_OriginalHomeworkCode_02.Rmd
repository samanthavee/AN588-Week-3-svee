![I love how chunky titi monkeys are](https://assets.isu.pub/document-structure/230706143934-6b4b2e34ca282ca67a8b26f4876f1f60/v1/ded975c198157a739b4ac00ce82f800b.jpeg)

# Preliminaries

Set working directory and load relevant libraries:
```{r libraries, eval= FALSE}
library(prettydoc)
library(yaml)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Homework Questions
Every Saturday morning, at the same time, a primatologist goes and sits in the forest to listen for titi monkey calls, counting the number of calls they hear in a 2 hour window from 5am to 7am. Based on previous knowledge, she believes that the mean number of calls she will hear in that time is exactly 15. Let X represent the appropriate Poisson random variable of the number of calls heard in each monitoring session.


## What is the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?
```{r q1}

```
## What is the probability that she will hear no calls in a session?
```{r q2}

```
## What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session?
```{r q3}

```
## Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30.
```{r q4}

```
## Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions).
```{r q5}

```
## Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30. How does your histogram compare to the shape of the probability mass function you plotted above?
```{r q6}

```
